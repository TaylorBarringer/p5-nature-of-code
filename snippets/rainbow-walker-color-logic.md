## Rainbow Walker Color Logic

This snippet creates a smooth, rainbow-colored walker by using HSL color mode, where the hue value is mapped to the y-position of the walker. The `colorMode(HSL, 360, 100, 100)` enables HSL color space with hue cycling between 0 and 360 degrees for a rainbow effect. The `hueValue` is dynamically adjusted in the `show()` method using `map()` and `sin()` for smooth cycling of colors. This ensures a gradient-like transition of color as the walker moves, creating a vibrant and continuous rainbow effect.

### Code Explanation:

- **`colorMode(HSL, 360, 100, 100)`**: Sets the color mode to HSL, allowing smooth gradients with hue cycling between 0 and 360 degrees.
- **`hueValue`**: The `hueValue` is calculated based on the walker’s y-position using the `map()` and `sin()` functions, creating a smooth, continuous color change.
- **`fill(hueValue, 100, 50)`**: Sets the walker’s fill color based on the `hueValue`, ensuring a dynamic color change as the walker moves along the canvas.

### Code Snippet:

```javascript
colorMode(HSL, 360, 100, 100); // Set HSL color mode for smooth gradient in setup()
let hueValue = map(sin(this.y * 0.02), -1, 1, 0, 360); // Map y-position to hue
fill(hueValue, 100, 50); // Set fill color based on hueValue
```
